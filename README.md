🚀 NORMAL VS PNEUMONIA X-Ray Classification | Convolutional Neural Network Project | CNN with PyTorch
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates Chest X-Ray Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with PyTorch. The model is trained to classify chest X-ray images into Normal & Pneumonia categories using deep learning techniques.

📂 Dataset
We use the Chest X-Ray Dataset for pneumonia detection.

Dataset Source: "C:\Users\amart\Downloads\Chest_XRay_Datasets.zip"
The dataset is preprocessed and augmented to improve model generalization.
